    "In this assignment, we are going to use python to find the numerical solution for the circuit you encountered in problem 4 of our second PSet. The goal is to learn to solve systems of (complex) linear equations in python. We will first look at how to define complex numbers in their rectangular and polar form. Then we will create a system of complex equations which has been derived using the node-voltage analysis approach in the PSet, and compute the numerical values for $\\mathrm{\\textbf{V}_1}$ and $\\mathrm{\\textbf{V}_2}$. \n",
